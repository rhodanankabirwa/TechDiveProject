Congratulations! You've been hired as a data scientist at a diamond wholesaler. You will be part of the newly established data department. The retailer has collected data on diamond sales over the past 10 years. Your company would like to better understand the diamond market, identify trends, and build a model that can predict diamond prices for next year. You and your team will put your data analysis skills to the test by uncovering insights about the diamond market.
1.	Provide a cleaned dataset. Document problematic data entries. Make exploratory analysis & summary statistics of the cleaned data.
2.	Build and assess your price prediction models.
3.	Use your price prediction models to predict 2024 sales. No model is perfect, and one should expect that the predictions take on a range of plausible values. So include this in your presentation of 2024 sales forecasting, along with possible weaknesses in your modelâ€™s predictions. 
4.	Build and deploy an executive dashboard to help upper management of your company use and understand your models.
